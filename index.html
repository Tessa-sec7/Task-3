                 <p> My name is Ezeiruaku Tessa. I am a law student, currently in her final year and this is my tech journey. </p> <br>
                 
                <p>I've always been enthusiastic about science and tech right from when i was a little girl, even though i didn't exactly know how it worked. Unfortunately, i didn't have the chance to study it and tech opportunities weren"t coming my way. Luck smiled on me when i got admission into the university and i heard about an existing tech club in my faculty. As you'd except, i quickly applied for membership, hoping i'd have easier access to tech skill trainings, webinars and even competitions as well. Disappointingly, i didn't get that either at first cause the club wasn't really an active one at the timeðŸ˜¥ðŸ’”. However, as administrations changed, opportunities began to appear, one of which i was able to get foundational training on UI/UX. Sadly, with no guidance and schoolwork on my neck, i let it go.</p> <br>

                <p>My passion didn't die there. As a growing content creator, i had to learn how to edit my videos and pictures using different editing tools to make my contents more creative and appealing cause well, money no really dey to contract graphic designer and videographerðŸ˜‚. So with that, i was able to unknowingly harness a tech skill of my own(video editing), though still learning and improving. Furthermore, with active participation in frequent administrations in the existung tech club in my faculty(now a general tech club for the whole school)as part of the executive team, i had personal experience in hosting tech talks on differrnt areas of tech and opportunities too,ranging from blockchain tech to crypto, web3, AI and peersonal data, selling digital products, etc. as well as visiting tech firms and also sourcing out tech oppportunities to other techies in the club(literally started giving back what i was looking for, the irony), </p><br>

            
                <p>My  efforts and participation awarded me with the position of the president of the club(hehe bragging rights) and i decided to use it as a means to further include other techies in sourcing for more tech opportunities and trainings at free or discount rates, which landed me here at genesys' upskill training under the web development cohort. It's really not been an easy one as the training period unfortunately clashed with the final semester of my L.L.B journey and with projects here, content creation there, web dev tasks and classes on one hand and the extracurrilar executive positions and activities i run and participate in on the other, i've thought of dropping it aside and focusing on the other responsibilities i have. However, as the overachiever her mother raised, of course you know i won't do that and i'm honesthy proud of the progress i've made so far. Question now is, as we get deeper into the technical sides to front-end web development, would i see it till the end or would i have to drop out at some point? Guess you have to stick around and find outðŸ˜‰. </p> <br>

                <p>So yeah, this is my crazy tech journey so far. How has yours been? I'd love to hear all about it below:</p> <br>
