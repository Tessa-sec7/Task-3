            <div class="name">
            <p> My name is Ezeiruaku Tessa. I am a law student, currently in her final year and this is my tech journey. </p> <br>
            </div> 

            <div class="first">
                <p>I've always been enthusiastic about science and tech right from when i was a little girl, even though i didn't exactly know how it worked. Unfortunately, i didn't have the chance to study it and tech opportunities weren"t coming my way. Luck smiled on me when i got admission into the university and i heard about an existing tech club in my faculty. As you'd except, i quickly applied for membership, hoping i'd have easier access to tech skill trainings, webinars and even competitions as well. Disappointingluy, i didn't get that either at first cause the club wasn't really an active one at the time(sad emoji with one tear and a broken heart). However, as administrations changed, opportnities began to appear, one of which i was able to get foundational training on UI/UX. Sadly, with no guidance and schoolwork on my neck, i let it go.</p> <br>
            </div>

            <div class="second">
                <p>My passion didn't die there. As a growing content creator, i had to learn how to edit my videos and pictures using different editing tools to make my contents more creative and appealing cause well, money no really dey to contract graphic designer and videographer(laughing emoji and the previous emojis again). So with that, i was able to unknowingly harness a tech skill of my own(video editing), though still learning and improving. Furthermore, with active participation in frequent administrations in the existung tech club in my faculty(now a general tech club for the whole school)as part of the executive team, i had personal experience in hosting tech talks on differrnt areas of tech and opportunities too ranging from blockchain tech to crypto, web3, ai and peersonal data, selling digital products, etc. as well as visitingtech firms and also sourcing out tech oppportunities to other techies in the club(literally started giving backwat i was looking for, the irony), </p><br>
            </div>

            <div class="third">
                <p>My  efforts and participation awarded me with the position of the president of the club(hehe bragging rights) and i decided to use it as a means to further include other techies in sourcing for more tech opportunities and trainings at free or discount rates, which landed me here at genesys'  upskill training under the web development cohort. It's really not been an easy one as the training period unfortunately clashed with the final semester of my L.L.B journey and with projects here, content creation there, web dev tasks and classes on one hand and the extracurrilar executive positions and activities i run and participate in on the other, i've thought od dropping it aside and focusing on the other responsibilities i have. However, as the overachiever her mother raised, of course you know i wont do that and i'm honesthy proud ofbthe prigress i've made so far. Question now is, as we get deeper into the technical sies to front-end web dev, would i see it till the end or would i have to drop out at some point. Guess you have to stick around and find out (wink emoji).
